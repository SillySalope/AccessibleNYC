The assignment just says to make use of geoJSON formatted data, and use L.geoJSON() in leaflet to make a map...

The steps I went through in class were:
1) download data
2) use QGIS to open the data and export a small part of the original data on geoJSON format, and to convert the coordinate reference system from 2263 to 4326 (NY state plate to WGS84(lat/lon))
3) add the geojson to a leaflet project, either by creating a .js file from the geoJSON and prepending `var myData = ` to it
or, adding the raw `.geojson` file to the project and using jquery `$.getJSON()` to load it
I then added data-driven styling to it by passing an options object to L.geoJSON()

## Progress
The cooordinate system was wrong. Now it's fixed.

## TO FIX
1 - Color of the markers, function
2 - Shape of the markers
3 - That bloody banner
4 - The popup message
